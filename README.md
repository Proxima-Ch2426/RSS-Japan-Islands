# RSS-Japan-Islands
Map decals for Tanegashima, Mageshima and Hachijo Islands. Comes with PQS map configs *(delete `Decals.cfg` if needed)*. Runways, launchsites and buildings have to be placed/configured manually.

### Tanegashima Island
The Island containing the Tanegashima Launchsite.

### Mageshima Island
Supposed landing site for the HOPE-X Spaceplane, now turning into a military base.

### Hachijo Islands
No significance in reality, but could be used for as an abort runway for a space-shuttle-like launch vehicle launching from Tanegashima. *(equivalent to Bermuda for a Space Shuttle launching from Florida)*
